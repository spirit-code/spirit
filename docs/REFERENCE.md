# Reference

The **Spirit** framework is a scientific project.
If you present and/or publish scientific results or
visualisations that used Spirit, you should add a reference.


### The Framework

If you used any components of this framework please add a
reference to our GitHub page.
You may use e.g. the following TeX code:
    
    \bibitem{spirit}
    {Spirit spin simulation framework} (see spirit-code.github.io)


### Specific Methods

The following need only be cited if used.

**SIB Method**

This stable method for solving the LLG equation efficiently and
including the stochastic term has been published by Mentink et al.: 
http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/22/17/176001
You may use e.g. the following TeX code:

    \bibitem{SIB}
    J. H. Mentink et al. \textit{J. Phys. Condens. Matter} \textbf{22}, 176001 (2010).


**GNEB Method**

This specialized nudged elastic band method for calculating transition
paths of spin systems has been published by Bessarab et al.:
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465515002696
You may use e.g. the following TeX code:

    \bibitem{GNEB}
    P. F. Bessarab et al. \textit{Comp. Phys. Commun.} \textbf{196}, 335 (2015).
