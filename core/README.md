Spirit
=============

This is the core library of the **Spirit** framework.

It is meant to provide useful and easy API functions to enable productive work
with Atomistic Dynamics Simulations and Optimizations.
The current implementation is specific to atomistic spin models, but it may
easily be generalised.

The library is written in C++ but has been wrapped in Python for easier install and use.
Other bindings should be easy to create.
