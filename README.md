Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>
---------------------------------------------

#### A modern framework for magnetism science on clusters, desktops & laptops and even your Phone

**Spirit** is a **platform-independent** framework for spin dynamics, written in C++11.
It combines the traditional cluster work, using using the command-line, with modern
visualisation capabilites in order to maximize scientists' productivity.

> "It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in
>  the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to
>  anyone else if machines were used."
> - Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

*Our goal is to build such machines*. The core library of the *Spirit* framework provides an
**easy to use API**, which can be used from almost any programming language,
and includes ready-to-use python bindings.
A **powerful desktop user interface** is available, providing real-time visualisation and
control of parameters.

### *Physics Features*
* Atomistic Spin Lattice Heisenberg Model including also DMI and dipole-dipole
* **Spin Dynamics simulations** obeying the
  [Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau%E2%80%93Lifshitz%E2%80%93Gilbert_equation "Titel, der beim Überfahren mit der Maus angezeigt wird")
* Direct **Energy minimisation** with different optimizers
* **Minimum Energy Path calculations** for transitions between different
  spin configurations, using the GNEB method

### *Highlights of the Framework*
* Cross-platform: everything can be built and run on Linux, OSX and Windows
* Standalone core library with C API which can be used from almost any programming language
* **Python package** making complex simulation workflows easy
* Desktop UI with powerful, live **3D visualisations** and direct control of most system parameters
* Modular backends including **GPU parallelisation**

### *Documentation*
More details may be found in the [Reference section](docs/Readme.md) including
* [Framework build instructions](docs/BUILD.md)
* [Core build instructions](core/docs/BUILD.md)
* [Core API Reference](core/docs/API.md)

Getting started with the Desktop Interface <a name="Desktop"></a>
---------------------------------------------

See [BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md) on how to install the desktop user interface.

![Desktop UI with Isosurfaces in a thin layer](http://imgur.com/QUcN4aG.jpg "Isosurfaces in a thin layer")

The user interface provides a powerful OpenGL visualisation window
using the [VFRendering](https://github.com/FlorianRhiem/VFRendering) library.
It provides functionality to
- Control Calculations
- Locally insert Configurations (homogeneous, skyrmions, spin spiral, ... )
- Generate homogeneous Transition Paths
- Change parameters of the Hamiltonian
- Change parameters of the Method and Optimizer
- Configure the Visualization (arrows, isosurfaces, lighting, ...)

*Unfortunately, distribution of binaries for the Desktop UI is not possible due
to the restrictive license on QT-Charts.*

Getting started with the Python Package <a name="Python"></a>
---------------------------------------------

To install the *Spirit python package*, either [build and install from source](docs/BUILD.md)
or simply use

	pip install spirit

With this package you have access to powerful [Python APIs](core/docs/API.md) to run and control
dynamics simulations or optimizations.
This is especially useful for work on clusters, where you can now script your
workflow, never having to re-compile when testing, debugging or adding features.

The most simple example of a **spin dynamics simulation** would be
``` python
    from spirit import state, simulation
    with state.State("input/input.cfg") as p_state:
        simulation.PlayPause(p_state, "LLG", "SIB")
```
Where `"SIB"` denotes the semi-implicit method B and the starting configuration
will be random.

To add some meaningful content, we can change the **initial configuration** by
inserting a Skyrmion into a homogeneous background:
``` python
    def skyrmion_on_homogeneous(p_state):
        from spirit import configuration
        configuration.PlusZ(p_state)
        configuration.Skyrmion(p_state, 5.0, phase=-90.0)
```

If we want to calculate a **minimum energy path** for a transition, we need to generate
a sensible initial guess for the path and use the **GNEB method**. Let us consider
the collapse of a skyrmion to the homogeneous state:
``` python
    from spirit import state, chain, configuration, transition, simulation 

    ### Copy the system a few times
    chain.Image_to_Clipboard(p_state)
    for number in range(1,7):
    	chain.Insert_Image_After(p_state)
    noi = chain.Get_NOI(p_state)

    ### First image is homogeneous with a Skyrmion in the center
    configuration.PlusZ(p_state, idx_image=0)
    configuration.Skyrmion(p_state, 5.0, phase=-90.0, idx_image=0)
    simulation.PlayPause(p_state, "LLG", "VP", idx_image=0)
    ### Last image is homogeneous
    configuration.PlusZ(p_state, idx_image=noi-1)
    simulation.PlayPause(p_state, "LLG", "VP", idx_image=noi-1)

    ### Create transition of images between first and last
    transition.Homogeneous(p_state, 0, noi-1)

    ### GNEB calculation
    simulation.PlayPause(p_state, "GNEB", "VP")
```
where `"VP"` denotes a direct minimization with the velocity projection algorithm.

You may also use *Spirit* order to **extract quantitative data**, such as the energy.
``` python
    def evaluate(p_state):
        from spirit import system, quantities
        M = quantities.Get_Magnetization(p_state)
        E = system.Get_Energy(p_state)
        return M, E
```

Obviously you may easily create significantly more complex workflows and use Python
to e.g. pre- or post-process data or to distribute your work on a cluster and much more!

### *Branches*

We aim to adhere to the "git flow" branching model: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

> Release versions (`master` branch) are tagged `major.minor.patch`, starting at `1.0.0`

Download the latest stable version from https://github.com/spirit-code/spirit/releases

The develop branch contains the latest updates, but is generally less consistently tested than the releases.
